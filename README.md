This repository contains examples and questions on do-while loops in Java. A do-while loop is a control flow statement that executes a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly executes the block as long as a given condition is true. It is particularly useful when the loop body needs to run at least once regardless of the condition, such as in menu-driven programs, input validation, or retry mechanisms.
